![alt text](src/images/readme.jpg "description")
Hello, couple words about myself - as a front-end developer, I have worked on a variety of projects, including single-page and multi-page web applications. My experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React has allowed me to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I actively interact with designers and back-end developers to implement new features. I am comfortable working with version control systems such as Git and am always looking to improve my skills through online courses and workshops.
